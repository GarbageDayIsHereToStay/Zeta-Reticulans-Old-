~New~:

Added a custom fire type sound for the heat lance
You'll now be able to see energy bullets at night

Existing Text Fixes/Changes (For translators mostly):
_____________________
Couple new settlement names (I add so few every time it's better you don't translate these piece meal and just wait untill they build up after a few months)

Bug fixes:
_____________________
Rimdevs changed the Anesthetic hediff to auto apply max severity and since i don't throughly read patch notes i'm just notcing, this change made the traq gun super OP. Fixed to the way it was before by making a new custom anesthic hediff.
